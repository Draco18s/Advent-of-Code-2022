*Day 1: Actually started on time for once.*
*Day 2: Started (2 hour 45 min) late because I misread the clock and got pulled into some Gunfire Reborn for 2 hours. It was worth it. Actual time taken: approximately 00:10:00, 00:08:00*
*Day 4: Started (14 min) late because I was distracted by Slipways*
*Day 5: I accidentally did part 2 for part 1 first (and had a few bugs in said).*
*Day 6: Lost about 30-45 seconds attempting an aproach that I abandoned as soon as I realized it was going to take longer than the method I went with in the end.*
*Day 11: Instructions were vauge about how to keep the numbers rational. I had the right idea at first, but due to the example data being what it was and because I was looking at the final values at the end in sorted order (not monkey order) I thought I was getting the wrong answer.*
*Day 12: There's no reason this should have taken me this long. Part 2, especially. I legitimately have no idea why part 2's initial attempt failed. Part 1 I overlooked that you could drop down distances further than 1 height unit and rewrote the pathfinder three times as a result.*
