*Day 1: Actually started on time for once.*
*Day 2: Started (2 hour 45 min) late because I misread the clock and got pulled into some Gunfire Reborn for 2 hours. It was worth it. Actual time taken: approximately 00:10:00, 00:08:00*
*Day 4: Started (14 min) late because I was distracted by Slipways*
*Day 5: I accidentally did part 2 for part 1 first (and had a few bugs in said).*
*Day 6: Lost about 30-45 seconds attempting an aproach that I abandoned as soon as I realized it was going to take longer than the method I went with in the end.*
